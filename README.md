Computer Graphics
How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        This was my first ever attempt at computer graphics, everything I have ever done has been text based, so I learned so much in this course.  For design skills, I think I learned a lot about how to implement in a 3D world, as I had never really done anything in 3D in an aspect of my education or career.
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        I think there were two main successful approaches in my code that helped me to complete this project.  First, completing the project in phases and adding elements one at a time, making sure that each element worked before moving onto the next step.  This has always helped me in code, as it helps me decipher what is broken and to fix it in small bites.  The second approach was to modularize my code into chunks and iterations.  Code reuse is so important when it comes to being efficient.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
      My long term goal is to secure a role in my company's "Tech Lab" sector.  There are literally thousands of roles, but I am interested in our cyber risk management, which will tie together my current role as an Asset Protection Invetigator and my newly acquired skills in computer science.  Educationally, learning computer science opens you up to so many different ways of learning, and a whole new world that I did not previously encounter regularly.
